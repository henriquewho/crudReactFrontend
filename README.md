# crudReactFrontend

This project consists of a React frontend, used with the /crudReactBackend application.

## Problems to solve

- Github pages have a problem with routing single page apps on the client side. This causes, for example, a '404 page not found' when trying to open the 'New Item' or 'Config' view of the application in a new tab.
